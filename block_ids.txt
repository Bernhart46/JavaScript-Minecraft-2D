0 - nothing
1 - grass block
2 - dirt block
3 - stone block
4 - oak log
5 - oak leaves

Min world height: 0 -> bedrock level
Max world height: 255 -> max block height (you can't place on 256)
Chunk Number: (default: 4, maximize to 8)

Here is where I left:
 - created pos and neg chunks with a gen chunk function
 - remade the data structure for storing chunks (obj[])
 - send chunkNumber from client to server through "init"
 - render chunks, add block, remove block

What I need to do:
 - ADD 0 ON SINGLE DIGITS ON TIMER ON SERVER CONSOLE ex: 02
 - rework physics: now: object ARRAY -> after: surrounding ARRAY
   -> put the surrounding blocks into an array and go through them

 - Send new chunks based on player X movements (fileread sync!!! not to block
  the main thread) (first do it without files and fileread, just get the new
  chunks from the pos&neg objects)
 )
 - cleanup chunks (if a chunk does not have blocks ,remove the chunk, same with
 columns)
 -> region files: 1 file -> 32 chunks
 -> player data into different file

 -> World gen:
    -> base biome (biome of the spawn area) should be random
    -> biome size should be random in a range (idk maybe from 8-16 chunks)
    -> on biome end there should be a chunk for smooth change to the next biome
    -> generate next biome type before the biome_end chunk! (so in the
    spawn chunk, generator already knows the left and right side biomes)

    -> surface... (need to plan this out)
